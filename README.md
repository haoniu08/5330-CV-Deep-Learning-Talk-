# 5330-CV-Deep-Learning-Talk

This repository contains demo code (notebooks), shadow implementation (partial) of CNN, RCNN, Fast RCNN and Faster RCNN architectures. The code is written in Python using PyTorch library. <br>

The original three GitHub repositories were forked from their respective authors were kept authentic. The shadow implementation of CNN feature extractor - part of the RCNN architecture was done by me, which serivces only for a learning/demo purpose. <br>

Common libraries like torch, torchvision, opencv-python etc. are used.
